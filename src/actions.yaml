migrate-ovn-db:
  description: |
    Run the Neutron OVN DB Sync utility.
  params:
    i-really-mean-it:
      type: boolean
      default: false
      description: |
        The default of false will cause the action to perform a dry-run and log
        output. Set to true to perform the actual sync.
        .
        NOTE: The neutron-api units should be paused while running this action.
  required:
    - i-really-mean-it
migrate-mtu:
  description: |
    Reduce MTU on overlay networks prior to migration to Geneve.
  params:
    i-really-mean-it:
      type: boolean
      default: false
      description: |
        The default of false will cause the action to verify that all overlay
        networks have been adjusted. Set to true to perform the actual
        migration.
        .
        NOTE: To avoid connectivity issues, running instances should already
        have been reconfigured with a lower MTU prior to running this action.
        .
        NOTE: The neutron-api units should NOT be paused while running this
        action.
  required:
    - i-really-mean-it
offline-neutron-morph-db:
  description: |
    Perform optional offline morphing of tunnel networks in Neutron DB.
  params:
    i-really-mean-it:
      type: boolean
      default: false
      description: |
        The default of false will cause the action to not commit the database
        transaction, effectively performing a dry run. Set to true to perform
        the actual operation.
        .
        NOTE: Performing this action is optional and will allow migrated
        networks to show as type 'geneve' to the end user of the cloud which
        also allows other `openstack network set` operations to succeed
        post-migration.
        .
        NOTE: Before running this action you should make a backup of the
        Neutron database.
        .
        NOTE: The neutron-api units MUST be paused while running this action.
  required:
    - i-really-mean-it
